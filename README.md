# horiseon-webpage
This is assignment #1 for UM coding bootcamp.

This assingment is for cleaning up the HTML file to practice optimizing code to be easy to read and consice. What I added in this webpage was changing some of the tags to be semantic tags to be more specific because there were several div tags with class names.

I changed specific tags to match its location to where it is on the page/what it is. I kept some of the class names and id names so that it would not interfer too much with the CSS and so it was grouped properly, without causing confusion.

Another exercise for this assignment was to implement code that would be beneficial to everyone viewing the webpage including individuals with disabilites. I added alt tags to img lines so people with disabilites who are not able to view the image as intended can understand what the image is.

This page was built using Github Pages, if you like to visit the webpage here is the link to visit [here](https://beyondneptune.github.io/horiseon-webpage/).
